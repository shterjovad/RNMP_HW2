As part of the second homework you will need to set up a Spark environment (https://spark.apache.org/) for big data analytics.



You need to apply the recommendation algorithm (alternating least squares, implementation https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/mllib-collaborative-filtering.html) to solve the movie recommendation problem over the dataset (https: //grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/100k/). Homework should include:



1. Project with the solution



2. A written document detailing the evaluation of the recommendation algorithm



3. Results and conclusions of the conducted experiments



bonus: Analysis of the same dataset with recommendation algorithms implemented in the library http://surpriselib.com/
